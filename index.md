I am a Research Fellow in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group at the University of Warwick working with Dr Matteo Brogi. My work focuses on atmospheric modelling of exoplanets and comparisons with space and ground based observations to constrain their properties, with the eventual goal of studying rocky Earth-like planets in the habitable zone which have the potential for biosignatures.

On this website, you can find information about my [research]({{site.baseurl}}/research.html), my publications and about me. Feel free to get in touch if you would like to know more!
