    <h1>Siddharth Gandhi</h1>

<p>I am assistant professor at the Department of Physics at the University of Warwick, working on the characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. My research aims to answer some of the key questions in exoplanet science, such as how do planets form, how diverse are the processes in exoplanets, and how unique is our Solar System and our planet?

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>My overall research goal has been to understand the diversity of physical and chemical properties of exoplanet atmospheres. My work has encompassed a wide range of theoretical developments, from self-consistent models to atmospheric retrievals across a wide range of observations from space based low resolution to ground based high resolution spectroscopy. This has spanned a variety of planet types from cool low mass super-Earths to hot Jupiters, with the eventual goal of studying rocky Earth-like planets in the habitable zone which have the potential for biosignatures. </p>
