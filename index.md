    <h1>Siddharth Gandhi</h1>

<p>I am an Oort Fellow at Leiden Observatory in Leiden University, working on the characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. I was previously a research fellow in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group at the University of Warwick working with Dr Matteo Brogi. I completed my PhD in 2019 advised by Dr Nikku Madhusudhan at the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge on various aspects of atmospheric modelling.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>My overall research goal has been to understand the diversity of physical and chemical properties of exoplanet atmospheres. My work has spanned a wide range of theoretical developments, from self-consistent models to atmospheric retrievals across a wide range of observations from space based low resolution to ground based high resolution spectroscopy. This has spanned a variety of planet types from cool low mass super-Earths to hot Jupiters, with the eventual goal of studying rocky Earth-like planets in the habitable zone which have the potential for biosignatures. </p>
