    <h1>Siddharth Gandhi</h1>

<p>I am a Research Fellow in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group at the University of Warwick working with Dr Matteo Brogi on exoplanetary atmospheres. I completed my PhD in 2019 advised by Dr Nikku Madhusudhan at the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge on various aspects of atmospheric modelling.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>My work focuses on atmospheric modelling of exoplanets and comparisons with space and ground based observations to constrain their properties, with the eventual goal of studying rocky Earth-like planets in the habitable zone which have the potential for biosignatures.</p>
