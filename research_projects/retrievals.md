# Retrievals with High and Low Resolution Spectrscopy

To find out the properties of the exoplanet atmospheres, such as the H<sub>2</sub>O abundance or the temperature profile, we use retrievals to compare our models against the observations. Retrievals often explore many millions of spectral models to constrain the atmospheric properties in a Bayesian framework. These have been used extensively to analyse observations from the Hubble Space Telescope as well as other low resolution observations. I have developed a new retrieval framework, HyDRA, from the ground up, to efficiently retrieve such low resolution observations. Furthermore, I have also combined the low resolution observations with ground based high resolution data to perform hybrid retrievals. Such retrievals incorporating high resolution data have only very recently been proposed owing to their complexity and computational expense, requiring state of the art computational and statistical tools for efficiency. One of the most promising avenues I have been exploring has been the complementarity of low and high resolution observations, which allows for more stringent constraints on the abundances of species such as H2O and CO with the hybrid approach (see below). My recent paper on these hybrid retrievals has been published in The Astronomical Journal and can be found
