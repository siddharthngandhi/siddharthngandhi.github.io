# Modelling Cloudy planets at High Spectral Resolution

Recently, we have begun obtaining observations of warm Neptunes and super Earths, many of which show thick cloud cover in their atmosphere. These clouds obscure the atmospheric signal and make detecting species more difficult. However, high resolution (R > 20,000) ground based observations have the ability to probe a much wider range of altitudes, and thus potentially observe above the effects of clouds. My work has been to explore the detectability of species such as H2O, CH4, NH3 and CO by modelling two cloudy warm Neptunes, GJ 436 b and GJ 3470 b. The figure below shows the effect of clouds on observations. These features are present above the clouds and our calculations show H2O and the other species are potentially detectable even with quite thick clouds with just a few nights of observing time on a number of telescopes around the world. We also find that the Earth's own atmosphere can potentially obscure detections of some species also present on the Earth, such as H2O. This work has recently been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and can be found
