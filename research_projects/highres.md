## Modelling Cloudy planets at High Spectral Resolution

Recently, we have begun obtaining observations of warm Neptunes and super Earths, many of which show thick cloud cover in their atmosphere. These clouds obscure the atmospheric signal and make detecting species more difficult. However, high resolution (R > 20,000) ground based observations have the ability to probe a much wider range of altitudes, and thus potentially observe above the effects of clouds. My work has been to explore the detectability of species such as H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub> and CO by modelling two cloudy warm Neptunes, GJ 436 b and GJ 3470 b. The figure below shows the effect of clouds on observations. These features are present above the clouds and our calculations show H<sub>2</sub>O and the other species are potentially detectable even with quite thick clouds with just a few nights of observing time on a number of telescopes around the world. We also find that the Earth's own atmosphere can potentially obscure detections of some species also present on the Earth, such as H<sub>2</sub>O. This work has recently been published in the _Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society_ and can be found [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498..194G/abstract). A recent press release for this work can also be found [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/water_on_exoplanet/).

## Molecular Cross Sections

One of the most important considerations when observing exoplanet atmospheres is the opacity of the atmosphere. Each molecule present in the atmosphere has its own opacity which varies according to its abundance and with wavelength. To accurately detect and constrain molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>O in exoplanet atmospheres, we require detailed knowledge of all of the quantum mechanical transitions that can occur. My recent work has been to compile the latest generation of opacities for high resolution spectroscopy, where accuracy is critical for detection. We use these new cross sections to explore previous detections of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, HCN and CH<sub>4</sub> in hot Jupiters and model the spectra of a super Earth, warm Neptune and hot Jupiter. This work has recently been published in the _Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society_ and can be accessed [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495..224G/abstract) with the opacities publicly available on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/mgnw5/?view_only=5d58b814328e4600862ccfae4720acc3).
