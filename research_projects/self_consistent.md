## Radiative-Convective and Chemical Equilibrium Models

Equilibrium Models provide a key tool to test our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres. These model the atmosphere assuming all of the input physics, such as the chemical reactions and the radiative processes. Equilibrium models provide the benchmarks to test our understanding of atmospheric processes and can be compared against observations to constrain out of equilibrium processes in the atmosphere. I have developed a new equilibrium code, GENESIS, custom built for exoplanetary atmospheres. GENESIS uses the latest mathematical and numerical tools to model a wide range of exoplanets, encompassing irradiated as well as non-irradiated atmospheres. This has been used to model a number of hot Jupiters (see below), as well as warm Neptunes and super Earths throughout my research. My paper discussing GENESIS and its applications to a number of phenomena in hot Jupiter atmospheres can be found [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.472.2334G/abstract).
