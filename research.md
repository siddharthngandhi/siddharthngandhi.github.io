My research is focused on answering some of the fundamental questions in exoplanetary science. These include:

1. What is the composition and diversity of exoplanet atmospheres?

2. What are the physical and dynamical processes that can occur in the atmospheres of exoplanets?

3. How did these planets form and how did they migrate to their current distances from their host star?

4. What do these exoplanets tell us about the uniqueness of our own solar system?

Some of the recent contributions I have made:

1. Development of a self-consistent equilibrium model custom built for exoplanetary atmospheres
2. A retrieval architecture which allows constraints on disequilibrium processes
3. First combined retrieval using observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer telescope and ground based high resolution observations from the VLT in a fully Bayesian framework
4. First detections of numerous species in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters from ground based high resolution and space based observations

Here, you can find some of the research areas which I am actively involved in, such as high resolution spectroscopy, retrievals and self-consistent modelling. You can also find a list of my publications here. Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to know more about any of them!
