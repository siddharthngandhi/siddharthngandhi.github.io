My research is focused on answering some of the fundamental questions in exoplanetary science. These include:

* **What is the composition and diversity of exoplanet atmospheres?**

* **What are the physical and dynamical processes that can occur in the atmospheres of exoplanets?**

* **How did these planets form and how did they migrate to their current distances from their host star?**

* **What do these exoplanets tell us about the uniqueness of our own Solar System?**

Some of the recent contributions I have made:

* Development of a self-consistent equilibrium model custom built for exoplanetary atmospheres
* A retrieval architecture which allows constraints on disequilibrium processes
* First combined retrieval using observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer telescope and ground based high resolution observations from the VLT in a fully Bayesian framework
* First detections of numerous species in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters from ground based high resolution and space based observations

Here, you can find some of the research areas which I am actively involved in, such as [high resolution spectroscopy]({{site.baseurl}}/research_projects/highres.html), [retrievals]({{site.baseurl}}/research_projects/retrievals.html) and [multi-dimensional atmospheric modelling]({{site.baseurl}}/research_projects/self_consistent.html). You can also find a list of my publications [here]({{site.baseurl}}/publications.html). Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to know more about these or other projects I am involved in!
