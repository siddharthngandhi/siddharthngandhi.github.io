My research is focused on answering some of the fundamental questions in exoplanetary science. These include:

* **How do planets form, migrate and evolve?**

* **How diverse are atmospheric processes on exoplanets?**

* **How unique is the Solar System in an exoplanet context?**

* **How common are habitable/Earth-like planets?**

Here, you can find some of the research areas which I am actively involved in, such as [high resolution spectroscopy]({{site.baseurl}}/research_projects/highres.html), [retrievals]({{site.baseurl}}/research_projects/retrievals.html) and [multi-dimensional atmospheric modelling]({{site.baseurl}}/research_projects/self_consistent.html). You can also find a list of my publications [here]({{site.baseurl}}/publications.html). Feel free to get in touch if you'd like to know more about these or other projects I am involved in!
