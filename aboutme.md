<!--I completed my undergraduate in 2015 at St Catharine's College at the University of Cambridge studying Natural Sciences. I was always fascinated by theoretical physics, as well as mathematics, and how it applies to the world (or worlds!) around us. I was always fascinated by all of my subjects, from quantum mechanics to astrophysical fluid dynamics and relativity. It was especially nice to see similar principles and ideas in very different areas of physics. I then started my PhD in 2015 in exoplanetary atmospheres supervised by Dr Nikku Madhusudhan, which I completed in 2019. Studying exoplanets was ideal for me given its fundamental interdisciplinary nature. I have also been a fan of science fiction, especially those which explore the cosmos and other worlds. Perhaps it is not surprising I ended up studying exoplanets!
As well as research, I am also a big fan of playing and watching cricket. Many a summer afternoon has been spent batting for my local team, though I'm not really good enough to be out there for too long! I also enjoy rowing, and coxed for most of my time during my time in Cambridge.-->
